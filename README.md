I compiled my flooxs decks into this github as a way to access them from my macbook and my linux desktop.

It should contain (as of 03/06/2025) files for the fieldplate and T gate structure.

# Research Updates
Major milestones will now be recorded in the readme as of 5/22/2025

## Experimental Data Recieved (5/22)
Experimental data from Dr. Anderson is recieved and plotted against our simulations. The simulations need some tweaking, and future additions to the devices include a layer of oxide between the gate and the AlGaN, slope tuning, threshold voltage tuning, and more. Currently roadblocks are an incomplete understanding of the microstructure and an accumulation of holes at the gate contact as a result of high doping (questionable).
